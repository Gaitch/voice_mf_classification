    This project explores the use of deep learning for gender classification from voice recordings. Using Mozilla's Common Voice Dataset, audio samples are converted into Mel spectrograms to serve as input for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model performs binary classification into male or female categories.Challenges like class imbalance and overfitting were mitigated through data balancing and dropout regularization. The model's performance, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, shows reliable results for this task.
